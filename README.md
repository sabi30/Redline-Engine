**The standard for high-performance, Linux-prioritized game development.**

Redline Engine is a modern, cross-platform game engine designed to provide **low-level control** through a **high-level interface**. While it aims for the future of technology, it maintains a core philosophy of hardware efficiency and deep Linux integration.

---
* **Linux-First:** Developed on Linux, for Linux, ensuring the best possible performance on the platform.
* **The "Redline" Balance:** Direct hardware control for power users, but a clean, intuitive interface for rapid development.
* **Legacy & Future:** Support for modern Vulkan/DX12 paths while maintaining compatibility for older hardware via OpenGL.
